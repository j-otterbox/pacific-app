# - basic database for samples 
# - needs CRUD functionality
# - basic information about the samples is tracked (callout, vendor, style, etc.)
# - need to track: status, ETA if samples ordered, data gathered
# - later: transmittals should be able to be created from here
# - should be able to filter table, group by vendor,

# experiment what you can do with tables in pyqt6 to determine what's possible
